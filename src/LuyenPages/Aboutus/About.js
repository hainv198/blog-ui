                    <p>Hi! We're Hannah & Nick, two creatives from The Netherlands that run a 'travel content creation' company
                        named Salt in our Hair. From our passion for traveling, photography, and sharing experiences, Salt in
                        our Hair was born on Instagram. As of May 2016, we set ourselves the goal to capture the world in a way
                        so that people see more than only their nine to five job.</p>

                            That guy with the big amount of curls, that's me: Hi, I'm Nick! I would describe myself as a photo
                            perfectionist. Keep on trying until it's done! Yeah, that can take some time, but hey, taking photos
                            is a thing we love both, so it's not a punishment to do. Since traveling, I found myself to be
                            interested in learning other languages.</p>

                            Hmmm... Let's see. I would probably describe myself as a girl who can't function when her stomach is
                            growling. That's why I'm always keeping one eye on the streets to find the perfect bakery (with
                            carrot cake). Next, I can't resist puppy cuteness, especially at the beach with sunset.</p>

                        Netherlands with sticky salty hair (quite an exciting explanation isn't it? üòÇ)</p>

                        almost daily. At the end of this trip GoPro featured one of our photos.</p>

                    <p>In the Netherlands, we graduated school, in the creative industry as a graphic designer and web

                        had the skills, so it was an obvious decision to start a travel blog. We launched our travel blog in May
                        2016.</p>
